                    <p>My coding journey started several years ago. I solved a simple computer issue by searching google and I had been asked if I had an interest in coding. After some convincing I began working with the beggining lessons in CodeAcademy and working with small projects with my friends that have web dev experience. Even with all my friends help I kept getting stuck on loops &amp; functions &amp; how they worked together. I became pretty discouraged and began drifting away from web development. I applied and was accepted to LaunchCode and now I am well on my way to becoming an all start developer!</p>
