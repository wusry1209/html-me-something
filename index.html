        <h1>This is My Coding Story</h1>
        <p>My coding journey started several years ago. I solved a simple computer issue by searching google and I had been asked if I had an interest in coding.</p>
        <p>After some convincing I began working with the beggining lessons in CodeAcademy and working with small projects with my friends that have web dev experience</p>
        <p>Even with all my friends help I kept getting stuck on loops &amp; functions &amp; how they worked together. I became pretty discouraged and began drifting away from web development</p>
        <p>I applied and was accepted to LaunchCode and now I am well on my way to becoming an all start developer!</p>
